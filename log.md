# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 24th, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Began FreeCodeCamp's Javascript Algorithims and Data Structures Course. 
It's mostly revision on basic Javascript but its great practice.
Completed the first challenge, making a shopping list with nested arrrays.

**Thoughts:** 
I like this style of learning to program because the roadmap is more clearly laid out in front of me.

### Day 2: May 25th, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Continued FreeCodeCamp's JSA+DS course. 
Continuing to work through Udemy Web Developer Course looking at using JS to change HTML and make web pages more interactive.


**Thoughts:** 
Enjoyed working through the JS project today with the Udemy course. Need to do some more maths work in addition to programming.
