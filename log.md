# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 24th, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Began FreeCodeCamp's Javascript Algorithims and Data Structures Course. 
It's mostly revision on basic Javascript but its great practice.
Completed the first challenge, making a shopping list with nested arrrays.

**Thoughts:** 
I like this style of learning to program because the roadmap is more clearly laid out in front of me.

**Today's Progress**: Continued FreeCodeCamp's JSA+DS course.

**Today's Progress**:

Began learning more about Node.js and how it can be used to create programs as well as power the back end of Web Development.
**Thoughts:**
