# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 24th, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Began FreeCodeCamp's Javascript Algorithims and Data Structures Course. 
It's mostly revision on basic Javascript but its great practice.

**Thoughts:** 
I like this style of learning to program because the roadmap is more clearly laid out in front of me.
